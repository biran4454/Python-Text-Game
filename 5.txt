You are at the top of the pile of rocks.
You have to lie down, but you can see the other side
of the rock pile! All you need to do now is to climb
down again.
You spot a small hole to your left, although in
order to open it you would need a shovel.
While looking at the hole, you also spot a small
piece of burnt fabric lying next to it. How did that
get there, you wonder. Was someone here before you?
