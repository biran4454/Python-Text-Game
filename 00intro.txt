*****************************************
You stare at the tall cliff face in front of you,
worn by thousands of years of wind and rain - an
ancient giant, frozen forever.
Its rough, sharp edges glint in the misty sunlight,
like daggers at the heavens.

This is the moment you've been waiting for.
All those years of training, all the time
you spent learning about the impossible
have lead you to here.

The adrenaline grips you.

+break

Overhead, crows circle the summit, searching and
scavenging whatever they can see.
A heavy drizzle sets in; the wind starts to howl.
You can feel it bite at you, even through your
fur coat.

Beneath your feet, the ground is frozen and bare,
only broken by hard mountain grass, stiff from the
cold.

+break

You notice a small stream winding through the valley.
It could lead to another entrance to the cliff.

You are wearing a pair of leather boots, a fur coat,
and a pair of thich walking trousers.
Your rucksack is beginning to get wet, and you are
beginning to get cold.

You see a small dark cave in the cliff. You know
that beyond that point, anything could happen.
Beyond that point there will be no help.
You will be on your own.

+Do you ENTER THE CAVE or WALK TO THE STREAM?
