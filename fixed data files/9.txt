Sweat trickles down your face as you hear the metallic clunk of the
gold door shutting.
The dim corridor is plunged into sudden darkness, and a musty smell
of damp rock begins to penetrate through the atmosphere.
Squinting through the sudden darkness you notice a tiny light at
the back of the chamber. You step closer.

The light flickers enticingly at you, drawing you closer like a
moth to a lamp on a cold winter night. 

You notice that feeling again that someone is watching you.
Suddenly you see something move.
At least you thought you saw something.

There it is again. Something huge and powerful. No mistaking it.

You try to calm yourself down and think things through.
How could anything be living here, in this cave?
It's just your imagination, and in this darkness, where you have
only yourself, you mustn't make an enemy of your imagination.

But you remember the doors - how could those get there? Something
must have got in. Maybe it's still here...
Wariness creeps through your body again.
Wariness turns into nervousness.
Nervousness turns into anxiety.

Your heart pounds faster. Blood pulses strongly through you. Your
eyes dart around.

A noise. A grunt. A screech. A screem.

Suddenly a massive beast jumps out at you, fangs ready, claws out.
You have no choice but to fight, but how to win a battle against such
a powerful beast?

+If you win you must RUN TOWARDS THE LIGHT
