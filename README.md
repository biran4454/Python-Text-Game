# Python Text Game
 A text adventure game made in python.
 Each location is a file named `locationID.txt`.
 Use `input` to enter a command.
 Use `inventory` to see inventory.
 Use `Quit` and press cancel to exit.
 If you attack a creature, press `y` to continue or `n` to go back.

## Notes
 Launch the python file via. idle because I'm too lazy to make it work without.
