You keep walking and walking along the seemingly endless
network of caves. As you get further inside, it gets colder
until you have to stop to warm yourself up.
Eventually, you reach the end of the tunnel: a huge pile
of rubble reaching up to the top of the cave.

You have come this far already - there's no point turning
back.
You think there might be a way around the pile, but you 
aren't sure. You could also try to climb up to the top
to see if you could get over it.
Alternativly, if you had dynamite, you could BLOW UP the
rocks.

+Do you CLIMB, BLOW UP, or find a route AROUND the pile?
