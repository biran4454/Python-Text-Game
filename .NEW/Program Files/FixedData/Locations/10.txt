Stepping through the platinum door you find yourself in a small,
cold room. It seems very geometric and angular, but oddly quite
un-symmetrical. Obviously this room couldn't have been created
by nature, so whatever built those doors must have built this
room too.
The room has a sort of damp smell, as though it's been empty
for years without anyone entering.
On the opposite side is a pile of rubble, and in a corner is a
trapdoor.

You bend down to touch the floor. It is ice cold and smooth.
Pressing your ear to it you are sure you can hear something
rumbling. What could that be?
Standing up again you slip and your foot knocks into something
solid and metallic.

!break

An old rusty chest, locked with a large padlock. It feels like
it's been here for hundreds of years, although you suspect it
hasn't been that long. The padlock is so rusted that a small
tug splits it open. Holding your breath, you lift the lid of
the box.

Inside the box is a skeleton holding a dagger and sword, with
gold coins at his head and a shield at his feet. There is also
a bright blue diamond with the word "peace" engraved into it,
and a piece of aged parchment.
