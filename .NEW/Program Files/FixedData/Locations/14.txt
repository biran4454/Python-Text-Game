Down a flight of winding stairs you hear the clatter of cheerful voices.
These must have been the voices youâ€™d heard early, they sound happy
and welcoming. You reach the last step and look up. A kitchen, small
but homely, spreads out before you. A medium size table stands in the
middle of the room laden with: bread and butter, fruits, milk freshly
milked, honey, jam, cakes, sandwiches; and in the middle a bundle of
flowers. Four children sit on benches either side of the table, a grubby
looking boy, two identical girls and a toddler with baby hair. They all
squeal in delight when they see you.
