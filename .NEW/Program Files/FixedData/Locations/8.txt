You reach the other side of the rocks!
You continue walking along the cave system for about 5
minutes, until you reach a dead end: a huge wall of
rock.

But wait... There are two openings set into the rock.
Intrigued, you walk closer.
They are doors! This proves that someone must have been
here before you.

You take a closer look at the doors.
One of them is layered with what seems like gold plating.
The other is layered with a duller metal - maybe platinum.

Tucked into one of the doors is another scrap of parchment.
+Do you take the GOLD DOOR or the PLATINUM DOOR?
