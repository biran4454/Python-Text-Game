You tag along after the woman, hearing the floorboards creak
beneath your feet. Nerves creep into the back of your mind but you

These must have been the voices you’d heard early, they sound happy
and welcoming. You reach the last step and look up. A kitchen, small
but homely, spreads out before you. A medium size table stands in the
middle of the room laden with: bread and butter, fruits, milk freshly
milked, honey, jam, cakes, sandwiches; and in the middle a bundle of
flowers. Four children sit on benches either side of the table, a grubby
looking boy, two identical girls and a toddler with baby hair. They all
squeal in delight when they see you.

to go, but something tells you that this is a bad idea. What do you do?
