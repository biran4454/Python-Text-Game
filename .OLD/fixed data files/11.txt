You’ve reached the light!

With the Mountain Giant defeated a great wave of relief spreads
through you and you realise you are exhausted.
You knew this trip would be difficult, and you can't turn back
now, but you still question if you should have spent more time
training for this.
The path is gravelly and sandy now, with a few rocks lit up by
the growing light.

As you walk towards the source of the light your feet crunch on
something hard. A small glint in the sand guides you towards
a tiny ruby laying innocently on the ground. You pick it up.

++Ruby

You turn your attention to the light.
Gazing more closely at it you realise it’s a lantern...
But... Why is it whispering? 
You wonder if you are imagining it - you are very tired after
all.

The light continues whispering and wavering for a few minutes, with
you completely in it's grasp.
Anxiousness is crawling up your spine, with excitement climbing after.
Could this be it? Could this be what you have come all this way
to find?

You feel the urge to grab it to touch it, but something deep in
the back of your mind tells you not to...
