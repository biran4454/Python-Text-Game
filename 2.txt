You walk through the cold, damp cave. Gravel crunches under
your feet; the sound echoes off the dull walls.

The cave is quite large, about 5 meters high and 7 meters 
wide. It goes on for 10 meters before curving out of 
sight to the left.

You look up at the roof, and see hundreds of bats,
all huddled together. You stare at them for so long you
forget to watch where you are going, and nearly trip over
a large rock.

Carefully making your way over the uneaven floor, you wonder
how this cave was formed.
Was it from an underground river, or was it made by
something else... or someone else? You keep pondering this 
until it is too dark to walk futher. Luckily you brought 
a small flashlight.

Reaching into your rucksack to get it, you can't shake the
feeling that you're being watched.

The torch lights up the entire cave - although there
isn't much to look at, other than rocks and spiders!
Making your way past a large bolder, you hear a sound.

Something is there, under the rock.
